# BreatheSafe-AI/ML-Based AirPollution Prediction
BreathSafe â€“ An AI-powered project for air pollution prediction, environmental monitoring and pollution control
This is an AI-powered project that aims to predict air pollution levels in India. The model is trained using historical data to forecast future Air Quality Index (AQI) for various cities.
AI for a Healthier Tomorrow

##Key Features

Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction: Forecasts AQI levels for different cities.

Time-Based Analysis: Analyzes seasonal and annual trends in AQI.

Location-Based Data: Predicts pollution levels for specific cities.

##Dataset

This project uses the Air Quality Data in India (2015-2024) dataset, obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes historical records of various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, and AQI.

##Technologies Used

Python

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor).

Numpy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

##How to Run the Project

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Open the [Breathesafe_AirPollution_Prediction.ipynb] file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Run all the cells in order.
