# BreatheSafe-AI/ML-Based AirPollution Prediction
BreathSafe â€“ An AI-powered project for air pollution prediction, environmental monitoring and pollution control
This is an AI-powered project that aims to predict air pollution levels in India. The model is trained using historical data to forecast future Air Quality Index (AQI) for various cities.
AI for a Healthier TomorrowProject: BreatheSafe: An AI-Powered Air Pollution Predictor
This project is an AI-based solution that predicts air pollution levels using advanced machine learning techniques and data from multiple sources.

Problem Statement
Air pollution is a severe global health crisis. Our project aims to address this by developing a predictive model that can forecast pollution levels, enabling individuals to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

Solution Overview
Our solution is a robust, end-to-end AI application with a powerful prediction model at its core. It transforms raw environmental data into actionable insights for users.

Features
AI-Powered Prediction: We utilized a high-performance XGBoost Regressor model to accurately predict the Air Quality Index (AQI).

Data Pipeline: The project integrates data from multiple datasets (city_day.csv and stations.csv) to create a comprehensive and accurate dataset.

Advanced Feature Engineering: We used advanced techniques like Lagging, Rolling Statistics, and Interaction Features to enhance the model's predictive power.

Interactive UI: The model is deployed into an interactive web application using Streamlit, making it accessible to a wide audience.

Performance Metrics
Our model's performance on unseen data is excellent, as shown by these key metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4.96

R-squared Score (R2): 0.997

This R2 score shows that our model is 99.7% accurate at predicting the variability in the data, which is a fantastic result for a complex problem like air pollution.

Future Vision: The Hybrid Approach
This project is a strong foundation for a more advanced application. Our future vision is to create a Hybrid Application that combines two key functionalities:

Real-time Prediction: Using a user's live location, the app will predict current pollution levels.

Future Forecasting: Users will be able to forecast pollution for any city and any future date.*
